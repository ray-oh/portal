# ⚙️ Internal Guides

These are **private setup instructions, workflows, and reference documents** for my personal systems and team projects.  

> 🔒 **All links below require explicit access.**  
> If you see a 404 or “Access denied,” you haven’t been granted permission—and that’s by design.

## ❓ “I Should Have Access—But I See a 404!”

1. **Make sure you’re signed into the correct account**:
   - For GitHub links: use the GitHub account I added as a collaborator.
   - For Google Sites: use the Gmail or Workspace account I invited.
2. **Clear cookies or try incognito mode** if you have multiple accounts.
3. **Contact me directly** to confirm access.
