# 🧭 My Personal Portal

Welcome to my central hub for projects, knowledge, and tools.  
This site indexes both **public documentation** and **private resources** (like internal repos and restricted Google Sites).

> 🔒 **Private links require explicit access.**  
> If you see a 404, it means you don’t have permission—that’s intentional and secure.

## 📁 Quick Access

- [📚 Projects & Resources](projects.md)  
  A curated list of active and archived work—public and private.
- [🎓 Learning & Notes](learning.md) *(optional)*  
  Tutorials, references, and personal takeaways.
- [⚙️ Internal Guides](internal-guides.md) *(optional)*  
  Setup instructions for private systems (Google Sites, self-hosted tools, etc.).

## 💡 Why This Exists

- **One place to find everything** — no more digging through bookmarks.
- **Public-friendly** — safe to share; private content stays protected.
- **Self-updating** — powered by GitHub Pages and Markdown.

> 🔗 Built with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) from a [public repo](https://github.com/your-username/portal).
