# 📚 GitHub Pages Documentation Template

This site was generated from a [documentation template](https://github.com/ray-oh/docs-template) designed to help you quickly launch a professional documentation site using **GitHub Pages**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Edit this content** in the [`docs/`](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/tree/main/docs) folder of your repository.
2. **Customize `_config.yml`** to change the site title, theme, and metadata.
3. **Commit changes** — your site updates automatically!

Your site is now live at:  
👉 `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`

> 💡 **Tip**: This entire site is built from Markdown files. No build step required!
