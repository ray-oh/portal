# 🧭 My Personal Portal

A public index to my digital world—linking to both **public resources** and **private/internal tools** (like private repos and restricted Google Sites).

> 🔒 **Private links only work if you’ve been explicitly granted access.**  
> If you see a 404, it means you don’t have permission—which is expected and secure.

## 📚 What’s Here?

This site serves as my:
- **Knowledge base**
- **Project dashboard**
- **Quick-access launchpad** for tools and documentation

All content is hosted via **GitHub Pages** and built from Markdown files in the [`/docs`](/docs) folder.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The **repo is public** (so GitHub Pages works for free).
- It **only contains links**—no private code or data is stored here.
- Access to linked resources (e.g., private GitHub repos, Google Sites) is controlled by **external permissions**:
  - GitHub: repo collaborator settings
  - Google Sites: “Restricted” sharing to specific emails

## ✏️ Customizing This Portal

This repo was created from a [documentation template](https://github.com/ray-oh/docs-template). To update:
1. Edit Markdown files in `/docs`
2. Push changes → site auto-updates in ~1 minute

> 💡 Tip: Use this as your personal homepage or team onboarding hub.
